# StudyLog NFC Tool

## Summary
I am dedicated to using programming to solve real-world inconveniences and challenges, aiming to spread the greatness of programming and IT. Over three years, my exploration focused on addressing the common issue of "motivation and habituation during study." This led to a unique investigation using NFC tags, with the goal of creating a tool for fostering the "ultimate study habit."

## Background
The proverb "consistency is key" is crucial for success in any endeavor. However, many face challenges in maintaining motivation, especially students with the abstract concept of "studying." Surveys revealed mixed feelings about recording study hours, prompting the idea of creating a tool for easy study tracking using programming.

## Purpose & Hypothesis
To address issues like "cumbersomeness" and "short-lived commitment," simplicity in recording study hours became the focal point. Inspired by my programming study abroad, I chose "NFC tags" for their convenience. NFC tags use "Near Field Communication (NFC)" technology, enabling easy information transfer. The aim was to create a tool where users could tap their smartphones with NFC tags to record study sessions.

## Method
### Tool Creation
To make the tool accessible, I integrated study recording into the popular "LINE" app using the "LINE API." Developed using "JavaScript" and "Google Apps Script (GAS)," the tool automatically records study start and end times on a Google Spreadsheet.

### Feedback and Advice
Feedback and advice received:
- Tapping for LINE trigger is cumbersome.
- Occasional recording bugs.
- Desire for multiple recording sessions.
- Potential for increased motivation by sharing study times on social media.

## Discussion and Development
### Discussion
The tool increased study times for approximately 71% of users. However, the remaining 29% showed no change or a decrease, indicating room for improvement. Over half of users found study recording not burdensome, suggesting the tool's user-friendliness positively impacted study habits.

### Further Improvements
Addressing feedback:
- Enabled single NFC tag for both start and end recording using conditional code.
- Improved bug issues with the help of Qiita users.

### Experience at Benesse STEAM Festa
Participating in the Benesse STEAM Festa allowed for presentation and feedback, with insights from various professionals. Notable feedback included exploring differentiation from other study recording services and considering a reward system.

### Insights from Benesse STEAM Festa Feedback
- Differentiation: Emphasized NFC tag simplicity and LINE integration.
- Reward System: Considered a point system for study efforts, inspired by Benesse's "Effort Award Points."
- Social Sharing: Focused on incorporating a "like" feature on shared study times for a sense of approval and potential dopamine release.

### Proposed Feature: Social Media Integration
Considering Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs," the proposed "like" feature aims to fulfill the "approval" need. Dopamine release from approval can boost motivation, potentially contributing to habit formation.
